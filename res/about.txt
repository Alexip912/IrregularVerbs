Hi, you are welcomed by an irregular verb simulator.

Here is a fun irregular verbs game to help students practice the spelling of past simple and past participle irregular verbs.
They can be used for organizing a lesson in a computer class, or for distance learning methods - so that students train at home.

The infinitive form of the verb will be displayed to you, and you will have to enter the two remaining forms of the verb.
